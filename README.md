## Description
The project is a system designed to help blind individuals ski by using object detection to detect the position of a guide in front of them and emitting a sound based on the guide's location. The system utilizes YOLOv5 models for object detection and is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi with Google Coral TPUs to ensure quick local inferencing.

The system aims to provide visually impaired skiers with a reliable means of navigating downhill slopes with the assistance of a guide. By utilizing object detection and sound cues, the system is designed to provide accurate and timely feedback to the skier, helping them to follow the guide and avoid obstacles.

The YOLOv5 models used in the system are state-of-the-art object detection models that can accurately detect and classify objects in real-time. The Raspberry Pi provides a lightweight and portable platform for the system, while the Google Coral TPUs enable fast and efficient inferencing, allowing the system to operate with minimal latency.

# About
This system has been developed for Sciabile Onlus, a non-profit organization that provides support and training to individuals with disabilities, helping them to approach skiing and other winter sports. The system is intended to enhance the organization's offerings by providing visually impaired skiers with an additional tool to navigate the slopes safely and confidently.
